# Lovable AI Prompt: Inklare Marketing Landing Page

> **Project**: Build a premium, immersive marketing landing page for Inklare - an author publishing platform
> **Domain**: inklare.com
> **Goal**: Authors should understand the full value without needing to try the product

---

## Brand Overview

**Name**: Inklare (pronounced "ink-lair")
**Meaning**: Ink (author's craft) + Lair (private domain) = An author's digital sanctuary

**Tagline Options** (use throughout):
- "Your story. Your Inklare."
- "Where authors own their kingdom"
- "Build your Inklare"

**Target Audience**: Independent authors who want to escape Amazon/Kindle, own their readers, and maximize revenue

---

## Design Direction

### Visual Style
- **Premium & High-Tech**: Think Apple product pages meets Notion meets Linear
- **Dark mode primary**: Deep blacks/dark grays with accent lighting
- **Accent colors**: Subtle ink blue (#1a365d), gold highlights (#d4af37) for premium feel
- **Typography**: Clean, modern sans-serif (Inter, SF Pro, or similar)
- **Imagery**: Glowing UI mockups, floating dashboard elements, subtle particle effects

### Animation Philosophy
- Smooth scroll-triggered animations
- Parallax depth effects
- Elements that "reveal" as you scroll (like unveiling a story)
- Subtle glow/pulse effects on key features
- NO cheap animations - everything should feel intentional and premium

### Inspiration References
- Linear.app (product storytelling)
- Stripe.com (feature presentation)
- Framer.com (immersive sections)
- Notion.so (clean and approachable)

## Page Structure

### Section 1: Hero (Full viewport)

**Headline**: "Your Story. Your Inklare."
**Subheadline**: "The publishing platform where authors own everything—their readers, their revenue, their future."

**Visual**:
- Animated book cover that "opens" to reveal a glowing dashboard interface

### Section 2: The Problem (Pain Points)

**Headline**: "Traditional publishing is broken"

**Three columns with icons/illustrations**:

1. **"Amazon owns your readers"**
   - "You write the book. They own the customer relationship. You're just a vendor in their marketplace."

2. **"Platforms take 30-70% of YOUR revenue"**
   - "A $10 book? You keep $3-7. They keep the rest—for doing what exactly?"

3. **"Zero control over your destiny"**
   - "Algorithm changes. Policy updates. Account suspensions. You're always one decision away from losing everything."

**Visual**: Dark, fragmented imagery—broken chains, maze-like interfaces, money flowing away
