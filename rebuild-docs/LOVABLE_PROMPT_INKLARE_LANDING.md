# Lovable AI Prompt: Inklare Marketing Landing Page

> **Project**: Build a premium, immersive marketing landing page for Inklare - an author publishing platform
> **Domain**: inklare.com
> **Goal**: Authors should understand the full value without needing to try the product

---

## Brand Overview

**Name**: Inklare (pronounced "ink-lair")
**Meaning**: Ink (author's craft) + Lair (private domain) = An author's digital sanctuary

**Tagline Options** (use throughout):
- "Your story. Your Inklare."
- "Where authors own their kingdom"
- "Build your Inklare"

**Target Audience**: Independent authors who want to escape Amazon/Kindle, own their readers, and maximize revenue

---

## Design Direction

### Design Philosophy
**Clean. Professional. Product-focused.**

The landing page should feel like a premium business tool, not a novelty. Let the product mockups be the hero. The ink theme lives in the brand identity (colors, subtle textures, logo) — not as scroll gimmicks or elaborate animations.

### Visual Style
- **Minimal & Sophisticated**: Think Linear, Stripe, Notion — generous whitespace, clear hierarchy
- **Dark mode primary**: Rich blacks (#0a0a0a, #111111) with careful contrast
- **Color palette**:
  - **Primary**: Black ink (#0a0a0a) — the color authors actually write with
  - **Accent**: Gold (#d4af37) — premium highlights, CTAs, key metrics
  - **Text**: Off-white (#fafafa) for readability, muted gray (#888888) for secondary
  - **Subtle depth**: Very dark grays (#1a1a1a, #222222) for cards and sections
- **Typography**: Clean sans-serif (Inter or similar), generous line-height, clear size hierarchy
- **Imagery**: Polished dashboard mockups front and center — the product sells itself

### Ink Theme Integration (Subtle, Not Gimmicky)
- Quill integrated into the Inklare logo/wordmark (subtle, not cartoon)
- Thin ink-stroke dividers between sections
- Very faint paper/parchment texture in backgrounds (barely visible)
- Ink-spread effect on button hovers (subtle, fast)
- Black ink as the dominant dark color — this IS an author's tool

### Animation Philosophy
- **Restrained and purposeful** — animations serve clarity, not decoration
- Fade-up reveals on scroll (subtle, 200-300ms)
- Smooth hover transitions on interactive elements
- Dashboard tab switching should feel snappy
- NO particle effects, NO floating elements, NO parallax gimmicks
- If an animation doesn't improve comprehension, remove it

### Inspiration References
- Linear.app (clean product storytelling, dark mode done right)
- Stripe.com (clear feature presentation, trust-building)
- Notion.so (approachable yet professional)
- Raycast.com (dark, minimal, product-focused)

## Page Structure

### Section 1: Hero (Full viewport)

**Headline**: "Your Story. Your Inklare."
**Subheadline**: "The publishing platform where authors own everything—their readers, their revenue, their future."

**Visual**:
- Large, polished dashboard mockup as the hero image (this IS the product)
- Show the Books tab with a sample book, clean and inviting
- Subtle gold glow/highlight on key UI elements
- Dark background with very faint paper texture

**CTA Button**: "Get Your Inklare" (gold accent color, high contrast) → links to pricing section or Stripe checkout
**Secondary link**: "See how it works ↓" (muted, understated)

---

### Section 2: The Problem (Pain Points)

**Headline**: "Traditional publishing is broken"

**Three columns with icons/illustrations**:

1. **"Amazon owns your readers"**
   - "You write the book. They own the customer relationship. You're just a vendor in their marketplace."

2. **"Platforms take 30-70% of YOUR revenue"**
   - "A $10 book? You keep $3-7. They keep the rest—for doing what exactly?"

3. **"Zero control over your destiny"**
   - "Algorithm changes. Policy updates. Account suspensions. You're always one decision away from losing everything."

**Visual**: Three simple icons representing each pain point. Keep it minimal — the copy does the work.

---

### Section 3: The Solution (What is Inklare)

**Headline**: "Inklare is different"
**Subheadline**: "One author. One platform. Complete control."

**Visual**:

1. **"Own Your Audience"**
   - "Every reader email. Every reading habit. Every preference. Yours forever."

2. **"Keep ~97% of Revenue"**
   - "Stripe processes payments. You keep almost everything. No middleman."

3. **"Your Brand, Your Rules"**
   - "Custom domain. Custom design. No platform branding. This is YOUR world."

---
